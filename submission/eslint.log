Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 6.8.0.

ESLint couldn't find a configuration file. To set up a configuration file for this project, please run:

    eslint --init

ESLint looked for configuration files in C:\Users\14373\desktop\cpa\semester_3\WEB222\assignments\a5\assignment\src and its ancestors. If it found none, it then looked in your home directory.

If you think you already have a configuration file or if you need more help, please stop by the ESLint chat room: https://gitter.im/eslint/eslint
