# web222_final
This is the consummation of two separate projects as a submission for the final project in my introduction to web development course (WEB222) at Seneca College. 
This project was required to be hard-coded and use all the fundamentals of web development learned during the course, including the CSS, HTML and JavaScript basics, as well as forms. Course materials that detail all of the concepts used in this final project can be found at web222.ca.
